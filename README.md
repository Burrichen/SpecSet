### Why?
Spectacular Settlements is a great resource, but there is such a thing as too many dice rolls. When making a capital, you are likely to roll over 50 times. This is too much especially when you consider that you may want to generate a couple of these at a time. Furthermore, there are a several balance issues: Trading posts have an 83% chance of being at war or in active conflict, the location of the settlement has no impact on its character and each location has a 12.5% chance of containing giant spiders (to name a few). 

So, I had an idea. A way of automating this process that also fixes the balancing issues (Which is the base program), but also has further options for different flavours of fantasy (Which is built-in to my toggleable DLC: Kurovia) 

To make things clear, I have added, removed and modified aspects the original document to the point where I am happy saying it is my own creation. These changes are not optional and built into my program, and will never be disabled or removed.

## This program is not intended to replace Spectacular Settlements. It is a tool meant to compliment the document as an alternate methodology. Please support the original creators.
