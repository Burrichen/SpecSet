Welcome to Burrichen's Spectacular Settlements Generator - or, the BSSG.

-------
Firstly, I should wear my inspirations on my sleeve. This idea was inspired by Nord Games' Spectacular Settlement suppliment, and many tables take direct inspiration from that resource.
However, tables have been removed, modified and added, both for balance and to ensure that this is a standalone process. I have done my best to document my changes in the patchnotes (Link to be added) here.

More TBA
