This is a space for tables that could be added to the program.

1. Religions
2. Economy
3. Local Dungeons (Could be a full expansion)
4. Region (Like Ordon etc, this should affect the size, happiness, focus etc)


I think realistically, whilst the idea of choosing the region beforehand would be cool, it doesn't make any sense beforehand. 
Region could affect environment etc. Having the baseline tables allows me to see what is missing. 
If a title as a (E), it means I am just editing the current version and it is NOT an new addition.

Types of Settlement:
- Add a hamlet. 
    This allows the creation of a small backwater lot that's not reliant on being a trading post.

Trading Post Origins:
- Frontier Outpost
    Originally a supply or support site for exploation, war or settlement efforts that never left.
- No Man's Land 
    Specificy that this could also be for tax evasion
- Seasonal Trade
    A temporary fair or harvest exchange that is busy during one time of a year, but is quiet elsetime.

Trading Post Specialities:
- Crafted Luxuries
    Skilled artisans produce small but exquisite goods, prized along the trade routes. Could also be a tourist trap.
- Animal Handling / Vechiles
- Security Services
- Front

Law Enforcement:
- Well-Equipped (E)
    Theres gotta be a better wording for this.

Leadership:
- Elder
- Hidden Benefactor

Shops:
- Bard's Store
- Scribe & Notary
- Trinket Stall
- Brewery or Disterillery
- Armourer
- Fletcher/Bower
- Auction House

Services:
- Remove Bows & Slings.
    I just dont see the point. 
- Messenger Service
- Interpreter
- Cartographer
- Matchmaker

Extra Intrigue:
This needs a full rework. These tables mostly do nothing and are too limited to really create any depth.

Recent History:
- Political Issue: Faux Pax
- Political Issue: Trade Dealings
- Political Issue: Border Despute
- Rival Dispute
- Successful harvest
- Cultural exchange
- Exconomic Shift

Politics:
One of the worst designed tables in the document. There's a 5/6 chance of it not being peaceful, rework this into a d12 or d20.

Events:
This table also needs serious design changes.
- Fool's Festival
    Reworked into just 'festival'

Oppertunities:
Reworking this INTO Events seems like a great idea.
- Political Intrigue
    The description of this is literally 'Missing Person' except it's a noble.
- Missing Person
    Merge with Political Intrigue and maybe a sub-table to determine who was taken
- Monster
    Adding a sub-table 'Complication' to add a little twist.

Weather:
Make a new program for this?

Danger Level:
Could be good as part of a larger rework. A new BIG feature potentially?
Danger is how dangerous it is outside of the location. Move to Basic Information.
