This is a space for tables that could be added to the program.

1. Religions
2. Economy
3. Local Dungeons (Could be a full expansion)
4. Region (Like Ordon etc, this should affect the size, happiness, focus etc)


I think realistically, whilst the idea of choosing the region beforehand would be cool, it doesn't make any sense beforehand. 
Region could affect environment etc. Having the baseline tables allows me to see what is missing. 
If a title as a (E), it means I am just editing the current version and it is NOT an new addition.


All tables:

Add a decent chance for a noticeboard everywhere. Maybe this should be a table all in itself.

Danger Level

Recent History: 
Merge all locations recent history tables. Seems logical.

Leadership: Merge all locations Leadership tables.

Other Locations:
- noticeboard
- Potter
- Glassblower
- Fletcher
- Armourer
- Book Store
- Black Market / Hidden Stall

Events: I had to cut a section here entirely because of raw stupidity.

Non-Commercial Locations:
Generating more of these might be a great idea. I would love this.
We may need to increase the amount to make up of that.

Commerical Locations:
Generating more of these might be a great idea. I would love this.
We may need to increase the amount to make up of that.

Alignment of Faith:
Complete rework to fit my religious system.

Shops:
- Bard's Store
- Trinket Stall
- Brewery or Disterillery
- Armourer
- Fletcher/Bower
- Auction House
- Reliquary

Services:
- Remove Bows & Slings.
    I just dont see the point. 
- Messenger Service
- Interpreter
- Cartographer
- Matchmaker
- Scribe & Notary

Organised Crime:
Rework into two tables, the original tab becomes visibility, and make a new table to make organised crime syndicates

Districts:
- Barracks
- Diplomatic Quarters
- Undercity
- Pleasure District
- Agriculture District

District Quality:
I feel like inserting 2 more numbers to stop the quality rolls from being so swingy would be useful.

Districts:
Arcane:
- Add a general Magic Shop for free.


Magic Shop Roll:


Location Notability:
I love the idea of changing this to something like 'Location Twists'
This means that they can be positive or negative, and have a bunch of different effects.
- Front
    This store is a Front
- Genuine 
    This store is just of high quality
- Poltically useful
    This store is of political Noteworth

Quality: 
Expand these options - make them match district, then make equivilent tables














Types of Settlement:
I was originally going to rename Trade Post to Hamlet, but it ended up making little sense. Trading Post is designed to be more shop-heavy.

Trading Post Origins:
- Frontier Outpost
    Originally a supply or support site for exploation, war or settlement efforts that never left.
- No Man's Land 
    Specificy that this could also be for tax evasion
- Seasonal Trade
    A temporary fair or harvest exchange that is busy during one time of a year, but is quiet elsetime.

Trading Post Specialities:
- Crafted Luxuries
    Skilled artisans produce small but exquisite goods, prized along the trade routes. Could also be a tourist trap.
- Animal Handling / Vechiles
- Security Services
- Front
- Expand food and drink to regional 

Law Enforcement:
- Well-Equipped (E)
    Theres gotta be a better wording for this.

Leadership:
- Elder
- Hidden Benefactor

Extra Intrigue:
This needs a full rework. These tables mostly do nothing and are too limited to really create any depth.

Recent History:
- Political Issue: Faux Pax
- Political Issue: Trade Dealings
- Political Issue: Border Despute
- Rival Dispute
- Successful harvest
- Cultural exchange
- Exconomic Shift

Politics:
One of the worst designed tables in the document. There's a 5/6 chance of it not being peaceful, rework this into a d12 or d20.

Events:
This table also needs serious design changes.
- Fool's Festival
    Reworked into just 'festival'

Oppertunities:
Reworking this INTO Events seems like a great idea.
- Political Intrigue
    The description of this is literally 'Missing Person' except it's a noble.
- Missing Person
    Merge with Political Intrigue and maybe a sub-table to determine who was taken
- Monster
    Adding a sub-table 'Complication' to add a little twist.

Weather:
Make a new program for this?

Danger Level:
Could be good as part of a larger rework. A new BIG feature potentially?
Danger is how dangerous it is outside of the location. Move to Basic Information.

Danger Type:
Cut completely. Doesn't seem fun.















Villages:
Hardships:
Extremely clunky mechanic. maybe work into danger and crime? Or intergrate it everywhere.

Specialty: 
Add tons more to this. Seems RIPE for creative output. University, good view etc.
- University / School 
- Great View 
- Cultural Heritage
- Trade Hub
- Defensive Position

Resources:
Make this list more reliant on other things, like environment and location.
- Furs & Skins
- Spell materials 
- Stonecraft
- Textiles
- Game
- Fruit and Nut Theres
- Specality Plants
- Clay & Ceramics
- Honey & Beeswax (maybe too niche)

Recent History: 
Merge all locations recent history tables. Seems logical.

Leadership: Merge all locations Leadership tables.















Towns:
Origin:
This should be greatly expanded and also edit some tables.
- Resource Discovery
- Scholarly Outpost
    Built near a natural focal point of magical energy, a critical ancient library, or a place suitable for undisturbed intellectual or supernatural research.
- Pilgrimage Destination
    Its primary existence is to cater to the steady influx of pilgrims visiting a profound spiritual site
- Defensive Choke Point

Priority:
- Preservation
- Innovation
- Logistics
- Cultural
- Sanctuary

Specality:
- Mercenary
- Spectacle and Entertainment

Visitor Traffic:
Changing the weights of this talbe seem good.
Even cutting Droves might be a good idea.

Non-Commercial Locations:
Generating more of these might be a great idea. I would love this.
We may need to increase the amount to make up of that.














Cities:
Origin:
- Royal/Imperial Decree
- Terminal Point of a Pathway
- Historical Monument

Priority:
- War Force
- Currency & Banking
- Magical Focus














Capitals:
Outside the Capital:
Make it a new step entirely 
Greatly expand the outside the capital rolls
Picture it as if a capital takes like 4 hexes, but only 1 is the city
- Makeshift Settlement (New Settlement Type) (E)

Leadership:
Make more tables and a process for the rules of the capital. Create a new step for it.

Leader's Intent:
This table makes no sense. Getting rid of it or reworking it could help.

Infiltration Depth:
Simplify this table

Visitor Roles:
This could be a lot of fun. Could be worth expanding.

Culture:
I'm not sure if this really works.

Pursuit of Culture:
Once again, not sure how this would work















Fortresses:
This is interesting becauese I feel like it's in a good place
I think this could be expanded into a dungeon generator, or even a mansion or estate
There is a lack of tables affecting other tables in this section. 

Reason for Construction:
- Art Project 

Residents:
- Add an Abandoned option
- Add a Squatter option (maybe)

Resident Relations:
- Merge with rumours to create some fun hooks

Fortress Secrets:
- Tunnel to a Different Location 
- Forgotten Prison 
- Massive Supply Cache 
- Hidden Corruption 
- Forbidden Knowledge
