Hello, and thank you for using my program.
This project started as a love for Spectacular Settlements but as I developed my project I realised there were balance issues I had with the suppliment.
My changes are designed to create more oppertunities, fix anomalies without much feature bloat.

For every removal or fix - I have explained my reasoning. You don't need to agree with all of my changes, but the idea is for you to
understand WHY the changes are being implmented. A hyphon (-) indicates the gap between balance and my thoughts.

Additions

Trading Posts:
Changes:
- Politics are removed - 1/6th chance for being at peace isn't right. The fact OTHER locations don't have this feature, but trading posts do too is illogical.


Districts:
Changes:
- Swamp Environment now counts as adjacent to water (To impliment), allows for Docks District to be rolled - This is a case of fun > hard mechanics. You can justify a watery swamp having a dock. Removing the option entirely seems overkill.
- Refined the quality table, rolls are now Poor, Fine, Good and Excellent - More range allows for more interesting results.



Capitals:
- Removed connections. - It's too thin to give content and it's directionless. You learn nothing other than it has some friends or some enemies.
- Remove Culutre - The table is here way too shallow and way to weird to describe in terms of gameplay. A 75% chance of having a whole capital city obsessed with some vague term is weird.
- Removed Pursit of Culture - If Culture is removed, so must Pursuit of culture. 



Additions:



Kurovia DLC:
Kurovia DLC can be disabled in the settings menu. It adds specific functionality for Kurovia, my fantasy world.
This program is designed to work with or without this. However, it does add quite a bit of content!
If you are used to, and happy using this program as is, I recommend leaving this ON. 
If you are having issues with the program content-wise, I recommend reading this document and then deciding if you prefer off or on.

Changes:

Additions:
Rather than tying some districts to areas, and then some locations to areas but also districts, i've simplified the process by having region specific districts contain the region specific REGIONS as well. 
Im aware this is an issue, and the workaround is simply too much effort. It essentially sextouples the codebase. 
Ix-Tal is the exception to the rule BECAUSE they are so different from just the first choice.
